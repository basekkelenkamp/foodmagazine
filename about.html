    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <p class="centered">
        We are an aspiring Food Magazine solely focused on students. We provide meals that are cheap and easy to make,
        and that don't require tools that you might not have in the house. We know that cooking a good meal is hard to
        fit in a students'
        busy schedule. For this reason we exclusively offer you meals that meat (pun intended) all your student wishes!

    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p class="centered">
        Food Magazine For Students was founded and created by Bas Ekkelenkamp. He is currently studying Creative Media &
        Game Technologies in Rotterdam. Last year he wanted to cook something fast, easy and cheap without having to
        spend too much time on looking for the perfect recipe. He decided the internet needs a food website that focuses
        solely on students who don't have much cooking experience, and don't have much time to cook.
