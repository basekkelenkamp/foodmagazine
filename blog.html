    <h3>#3 - Find motivation to cook</h3>
    <p class="centered">
        I know, finding time to cook is difficult. With all the school assignments, and teachers that
        literally bomb you with deadlines. I am a strong believer that, especially for younger people, starting is the
        hardest part. Don't
        worry about it! Once you get into the rhythm of cooking you will be making your own meals every single day, and
        there is no one that can stop you! Everyone needs a school break. Instead of gaming or binge watching netflix,
        maybe cooking might be your cup of tea. </p>

    <h3>#2 - Health</h3>
    <p class="centered">
        Cooking healthy might sound like a hard task but it is the easiest thing in the world! A healthy meal might just
        be the most delicious meal you ever had. Not only that, you are truly taking care of your own body. So, what's
        the
        catch? NOTHING. I don't know who decided that healthy food cannot be tasty, but this is the BIGGEST MYTH EVER.
        Lots of things can be done to eat heatlhier. Simple things like adding less salt and sugar to your meals is a
        great start. Replacing red meat by more healthy equivalents is very recommendable as well. Our recipes take
        these tips into account and more. For more healthy food tips be on the lookout for new blog posts.
